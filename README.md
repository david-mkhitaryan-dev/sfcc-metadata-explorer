# sfcc-metadata-explorer README

This extension consists of a tree view in the explorer to navigate through your sandbox metadata. There are several actions that can be applied to any given piece of metadata in order to modify the metadata in your sandbox.

## Features

This project is just getting started...

## Requirements

- A Sales Force Commerce Cloud (SFCC) sandbox instance is required. Obvious, I know!
- A __dw.json__ configuration file is required to setup the connection to your SFCC sandbox isntance(s). This is in a format also used by the Prophet Debugger VSCode extension [1], and dwupload [2]
